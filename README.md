# -Graduation-projects-dictionary-

Project Description
the aim of the project target both graduate student and student , by creating 
dictionary of graduation projects , our program deal with the graduate student to add 
his projects and search for projects in a specific year under specific project category 
and display it ,also deal the student to take a overview of the projects and search it 
by category in specific year it so it can help him in future, finally the benefits of this 
program we help the user to know the previous projects that graduate students made 
so it may inspires and thinks of a new project that benefits the community 

requirements operations 
Search → about project by year in specific category 
print → all projects under specific category in specific year , print all projects in 
program with its posters insert → add new project, ,years in tree

Data Structure used:
here tree data structure are used to organize data in a particular order, depends on the year 
of project release and inside each node we save tha information of projects using two 
double link list , each of them will save information of project under specific 
category in a specific year. 
binary tree data structure is the best for search operation than other data structures 
except Hash table , it is meet our needs but it consume the time in adding operation 
so we used another data structure which double linked list , it is better in add at last 
adding adding at beginning also we can traversal in both ways so that will help us 
although its complexity in search O(n) but it consider better than tree in addition 
Finally, if we want to reimplement our program using a different data structure, we 
will do so by using a tree data structure for the categories and a map for the years and 
that would make searching faster and improve our project.
